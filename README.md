# Beam_Break_Code

* beam_break_code contains the code for the ir beam break sensors with no test variables or serial monitor print. It uses Pin 4 to read in the digital signal from the sensor and pin 12 to send the digital signal output of the state of the beam. 1 means broken beam and 0 means unbroken beam.

* beam_break_code_with_serial_monitor_and_test_variables is the same as the previos code but contais a serial monitor output for debugging and verifying that the inputs and outputs are correct. It also uses PIN 8 to read in the output from PIN 12 to check the status.
